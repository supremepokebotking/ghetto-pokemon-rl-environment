##NOT MAINTAINED! Fork and maintain yourself.

Environment I made back in 2019 to use Pokemon to practice reinforcement learning. Doesn't simulate battles perfectly, but good enough for me to verify that I could make ML models that can understand the game.

I currently possess far more powerful tools than this, and have little to no use for it. But maybe someone else does.
